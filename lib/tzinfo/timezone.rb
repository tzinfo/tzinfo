  # Timezone is the base class of all timezones. It provides a factory method,
  # 'get', to access timezones by identifier. Once a specific Timezone has been
  # retrieved, DateTimes, Times and timestamps can be converted between the UTC
  # and the local time for the zone. For example:
  #
  #   tz = TZInfo::Timezone.get('America/New_York')
  #   puts tz.utc_to_local(DateTime.new(2005,8,29,15,35,0)).to_s
  #   puts tz.local_to_utc(Time.utc(2005,8,29,11,35,0)).to_s
  #   puts tz.utc_to_local(1125315300).to_s
  #
  # Each time conversion method returns an object of the same type it was
  # passed.
  #
  # The Timezone class is thread-safe. It is safe to use class and instance
  # methods of Timezone in concurrently executing threads. Instances of Timezone
  # can be shared across thread boundaries.
